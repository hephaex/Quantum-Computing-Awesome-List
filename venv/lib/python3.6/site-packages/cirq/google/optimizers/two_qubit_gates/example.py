"""Example application of the two-qubit gate compilation algorithm.

This script demonstrates construction and usage of the GateTabulation class.
This object is used to compile arbitrary two qubit gates using products of the
form

k_3 A k_2 A k_1 A k_0
or
k_2 A k_1 A k_0

where A is a fixed two-qubit gate and k_j are arbitrary single qubit gates.

The script generates the GateTabulation object associated with a base gate A
(sqrt(ISWAP) with some C-phase). It then generates a collection of 1000 randomly
generated 2-qubit gates and attempts to 'compile' them using the base gate.
Finally, it displays statistics on the process fidelity between the compiled
and desired gates.
