    r"""Two-qubit state tomography.

    To measure the density matrix of the output state of a two-qubit circuit,
    different combinations of I, X/2 and Y/2 operations are applied to the
    two qubits before measurements in the z-basis to determine the state
    probabilities P_00, P_01, P_10.

    The density matrix rho is decomposed into an operator-sum representation
    \sum_{i, j} c_ij * sigma_i \bigotimes sigma_j, where i, j = 0, 1, 2,
    3 and sigma_0 = I, sigma_1 = sigma_x, sigma_2 = sigma_y, sigma_3 =
    sigma_z are the single-qubit Identity and Pauli matrices.

    Based on the measured probabilities probs and the transformations of the
    measurement operator by different basis rotations, one can build an
    overdetermined set of linear equations.

    As an example, if the identity operation (I) is applied to both qubits,
    the measurement operators are (I +/- sigma_z) \bigotimes (I +/- sigma_z).
    The state probabilities P_00, P_01, P_10 thus obtained contribute to the
    following linear equations (setting c_00 = 1):

    c_03 + c_30 + c_33 = 4*P_00 - 1
    -c_03 + c_30 - c_33 = 4*P_01 - 1
    c_03 - c_30 - c_33 = 4*P_10 - 1

    And if a Y/2 rotation is applied to the first qubit and a X/2 rotation
    is applied to the second qubit before measurement, the measurement
    operators are (I -/+ sigma_x) \bigotimes (I +/- sigma_y). The probabilities
    obtained instead contribute to the following linear equations:

    c_02 - c_10 - c_12 = 4*P_00 - 1
    -c_02 - c_10 + c_12 = 4*P_01 - 1
    c_02 + c_10 + c_12 = 4*P_10 - 1

    Note that this set of equations has the same form as the first set under
    the transformation c_03 <-> c_02, c_30 <-> -c_10 and c_33 <-> -c_12.

    Since there are 9 possible combinations of rotations (each producing 3
    independent probabilities) and a total of 15 unknown coefficients c_ij,
    one can cast all the measurement results into a overdetermined set of
    linear equations numpy.dot(mat, c) = probs. Here c is of length 15 and
    contains all the c_ij's (except c_00 which is set to 1), and mat is a 27
    by 15 matrix having three non-zero elements in each row that are either
    1 or -1.

    The least-square solution to the above set of linear equations is then
    used to construct the density matrix rho.

    """Generates a two-qubit Clifford gate.

    An integer (idx) from 0 to 11519 is used to generate a two-qubit Clifford
    gate which is constructed with single-qubit X and Y rotations and CZ gates.
    The decomposition of the Cliffords follow those described in the appendix
    of Barends et al., Nature 508, 500.

    The integer idx is first decomposed into idx_0 (which ranges from 0 to
    23), idx_1 (ranging from 0 to 23) and idx_2 (ranging from 0 to 19). idx_0
    and idx_1 determine the two single-qubit rotations which happen at the
    beginning of all two-qubit Clifford gates. idx_2 determines the
    subsequent gates in the following:

    a) If idx_2 = 0, do nothing so the Clifford is just two single-qubit
    Cliffords (total of 24*24 = 576 possibilities).

    b) If idx_2 = 1, perform a CZ, followed by -Y/2 on q_0 and Y/2 on q_1,
    followed by another CZ, followed by Y/2 on q_0 and -Y/2 on q_1, followed
    by one more CZ and finally a Y/2 on q_1. The Clifford is then a member of
    the SWAP-like class (total of 24*24 = 576 possibilities).

    c) If 2 <= idx_2 <= 10, perform a CZ followed by a member of the S_1
    group on q_0 and a member of the S_1^(Y/2) group on q_1. The Clifford is
    a member of the CNOT-like class (a total of 3*3*24*24 = 5184 possibilities).

    d) If 11 <= idx_2 <= 19, perform a CZ, followed by Y/2 on q_0 and -X/2 on
    q_1, followed by another CZ, and finally a member of the S_1^(Y/2) group on
    q_0 and a member of the S_1^(X/2) group on q_1. The Clifford is a member
    of the iSWAP-like class (a total of 3*3*24*24 = 5184 possibilities).

    Through the above process, all 11520 members of the two-qubit Clifford
    group may be generated.
