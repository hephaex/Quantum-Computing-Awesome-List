    """A simulator for density matrices and noisy quantum circuits.

    This simulator can be applied on circuits that are made up of operations
    that have:
        * a `_channel_` method
        * a `_mixture_` method for a probabilistic combination of unitary gates.
        * a `_unitary_` method
        * a `_has_unitary_` and `_apply_unitary_` method.
        * measurements
        * a `_decompose_` that eventually yields one of the above
    That is, the circuit must have elements that follow on of the protocols:
        * `cirq.SupportsChannel`
        * `cirq.SupportsMixture`
        * `cirq.SupportsConsistentApplyUnitary`
        * `cirq.SupportsUnitary`
        * `cirq.SupportsDecompose`
    or is a measurement.

    This simulator supports three types of simulation.

    Run simulations which mimic running on actual quantum hardware. These
    simulations do not give access to the density matrix (like actual hardware).
    There are two variations of run methods, one which takes in a single
    (optional) way to resolve parameterized circuits, and a second which
    takes in a list or sweep of parameter resolver:

        run(circuit, param_resolver, repetitions)

        run_sweep(circuit, params, repetitions)

    These methods return `TrialResult`s which contain both the measurement
    results, but also the parameters used for the parameterized
    circuit operations. The initial state of a run is always the all 0s state
    in the computational basis.

    By contrast the simulate methods of the simulator give access to the density
    matrix of the simulation at the end of the simulation of the circuit.
    Note that if the circuit contains measurements then the density matrix
    is that result for those particular measurement results. For example
    if there is one measurement, then the simulation may result in the
    measurement result for this measurement, and the density matrix will
    be that conditional on that result. It will not be the density matrix formed
    by summing over the different measurements and their probabilities.
    The simulate methods take in two parameters that the run methods do not: a
    qubit order and an initial state. The qubit order is necessary because an
    ordering must be chosen for the kronecker product (see
    `DensityMatrixTrialResult` for details of this ordering). The initial
    state can be either the full density matrix, the full wave function (for
    pure states), or an integer which represents the initial state of being
    in a computational basis state for the binary representation of that
    integer. Similar to run methods, there are two simulate methods that run
    for single simulations or for sweeps across different parameters:

        simulate(circuit, param_resolver, qubit_order, initial_state)

        simulate_sweep(circuit, params, qubit_order, initial_state)

    The simulate methods in contrast to the run methods do not perform
    repetitions. The result of these simulations is a
    `DensityMatrixTrialResult` which contains, in addition to measurement
    results and information about the parameters that were used in the
    simulation, access to the density matrix via the `density_matrix` method.

    If one wishes to perform simulations that have access to the
    density matrix as one steps through running the circuit there is a generator
    which can be iterated over and each step is an object that gives access
    to the density matrix.  This stepping through a `Circuit` is done on a
    `Moment` by `Moment` manner.

        simulate_moment_steps(circuit, param_resolver, qubit_order,
                              initial_state)

    One can iterate over the moments via

        for step_result in simulate_moments(circuit):
           # do something with the density matrix via
           # step_result.density_matrix()

    The density matrix that is stored in this result is returned in the
    computational basis with these basis states defined by the qubit_map.
    In particular the value in the qubit_map is the index of the qubit,
    and these are translated into binary vectors where the last qubit is
    the 1s bit of the index, the second-to-last is the 2s bit of the index,
    and so forth (i.e. big endian ordering). The density matrix is a
    `2 ** num_qubits` square matrix, with rows and columns ordered by
    the computational basis as just described.

    Example:
         qubit_map: {QubitA: 0, QubitB: 1, QubitC: 2}
         Then the returned density matrix will have (row and column) indices
