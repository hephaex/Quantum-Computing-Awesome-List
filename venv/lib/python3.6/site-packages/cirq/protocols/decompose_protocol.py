    All decomposition methods should ultimately terminate on basic 1-qubit and
    2-qubit gates included by default in Cirq. Cirq does not make any guarantees
    about what the final gate set is. Currently, decompositions within Cirq
    happen to converge towards the X, Y, Z, CZ, PhasedX, specified-matrix gates,
    and others. This set will vary from release to release. Because of this
    variability, it is important for consumers of decomposition to look for
    generic properties of gates, such as "two qubit gate with a unitary matrix",
    instead of specific gate types such as CZ gates (though a consumer is
    of course free to handle CZ gates in a special way, and consumers can
    give an `intercepting_decomposer` to `cirq.decompose` that attempts to
    target a specific gate set).

    For example, `cirq.TOFFOLI` has a `_decompose_` method that returns a pair
    of Hadamard gates surrounding a `cirq.CCZ`. Although `cirq.CCZ` is not a
    1-qubit or 2-qubit operation, it specifies its own `_decompose_` method
    that only returns 1-qubit or 2-qubit operations. This means that iteratively
    decomposing `cirq.TOFFOLI` terminates in 1-qubit and 2-qubit operations, and
    so almost all decomposition-aware code will be able to handle `cirq.TOFFOLI`
    instances.

    Callers are responsible for iteratively decomposing until they are given
    operations that they understand. The `cirq.decompose` method is a simple way
    to do this, because it has logic to recursively decompose until a given
    `keep` predicate is satisfied.

    Code implementing `_decompose_` MUST NOT create cycles, such as a gate A
    decomposes into a gate B which decomposes back into gate A. This will result
    in infinite loops when calling `cirq.decompose`.

    It is permitted (though not recommended) for the chain of decompositions
    resulting from an operation to hit a dead end before reaching 1-qubit or
    2-qubit operations. When this happens, `cirq.decompose` will raise
    a `TypeError` by default, but can be configured to ignore the issue or
    raise a caller-provided error.

class SupportsDecomposeWithQubits(Protocol):
    """An object that can be decomposed into operations on given qubits.

    Returning `NotImplemented` or `None` means "not decomposable". Otherwise an
    operation, list of operations, or generally anything meeting the `OP_TREE`
    contract can be returned.

    For example, a SWAP gate can be turned into three CNOTs. But in order to
    describe those CNOTs one must be able to talk about "the target qubit" and
    "the control qubit". This can only be done once the qubits-to-be-swapped are
    known.

    The main user of this protocol is `GateOperation`, which decomposes itself
    by delegating to its gate. The qubits argument is needed because gates are
    specified independently of target qubits and so must be told the relevant
    qubits. A `GateOperation` implements `SupportsDecompose` as long as its gate
    implements `SupportsDecomposeWithQubits`.

            Note that `val` will be passed into `intercepting_decomposer`, even

        on_stuck_raise: If there is an operation that can't be decomposed and
            also can't be kept, `on_stuck_raise` is used to determine what error
            to raise. `on_stuck_raise` can either directly be an `Exception`, or
            a method that takes the problematic operation and returns an
            `Exception`. If `on_stuck_raise` is set to `None` or a method that
            returns `None`, undecomposable operations are simply silently kept.
